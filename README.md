# Atreus87

This repository contains the design files for the next DIY ergonomic keyboard I
am designing and building. The keyboard is based closely on the Atreus and the Atreus62; however, it will be fitted with exactly 87 keys, making it a drop-in replacement for standard TKL keyboards.

The image below shows a very early preview of the layout of the board.

# Ergomod

This repository contains the design files for my next DIY ergonomic keyboard.
This keyboard will be a drop in replacement for a standard TKL keyboard with
exactly 87 keys. Eventually it should be modular as well, splitting into three
separate pieces.

The name, along with everything else, is still a work in progress.
